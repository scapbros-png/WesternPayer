    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: <strong>[05-11-2025]</strong></p>
    <p class="lead">This Refund Policy describes how refunds are handled for transactions made through <strong>Western Payer</strong> (<a href="https://scapbros-png.github.io/WesternPayer/">https://scapbros-png.github.io/WesternPayer/</a>).</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Western Payer (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides digital financial services such as AEPS, Micro ATM, Bill Payments, Money Transfer, and Wallet services. We strive to ensure smooth and secure transactions for all users. This Refund Policy explains when and how refunds are issued for payments made through our platform.</p>

    <h2>2. No automatic refunds</h2>
    <p>Once a successful transaction has been processed through Western Payer, it cannot be automatically reversed or refunded unless a verified transaction error or duplicate debit occurs.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility for refund</h2>
    <p>A refund may be initiated in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The transaction failed but the amount was debited from your account.</li>
      <li>The service (AEPS withdrawal, recharge, bill payment, etc.) was not delivered due to a technical error on our side or from our payment partner.</li>
      <li>A duplicate transaction was made by mistake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refunds are <strong>not provided</strong> for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User errors (wrong account number, wrong UPI ID, etc.).</li>
      <li>Network delays or issues caused by your bank or payment app.</li>
      <li>Services that have already been successfully processed or completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Refund process</h2>
    <p>If you believe your transaction qualifies for a refund, please contact our support team within <strong>3 business days</strong> of the transaction by emailing <a href="mailto:help@westernpayer.com">help@westernpayer.com</a>. Include the following details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction ID / Reference Number</li>
      <li>Date and Time of Transaction</li>
      <li>Registered Mobile Number / Email</li>
      <li>Amount and Service Type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team will review your request and verify the transaction with our payment partner or bank.</p>

    <h2>5. Refund timeline</h2>
    <p>Approved refunds are usually processed within <strong>7 to 10 business days</strong> after verification. Refunds are credited to the same payment source used for the original transaction. In some cases, processing time may depend on your bank or payment gateway.</p>

    <h2>6. Cancellation policy</h2>
    <p>As our services are processed instantly, orders once placed cannot be cancelled after payment. Please verify details carefully before confirming any transaction.</p>

    <h2>7. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>If you raise a chargeback through your bank or payment provider, please inform us so we can coordinate resolution. Unauthorized chargebacks may delay refund processing.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact information</h2>
